If architecture is frozen music, then I'm a designer at heart. I want to curate tailored soundscapes that tickle your ear drums in the right way and make sonically appealing pieces of work that anyone could enjoy. I'm a sound designer, musician, and audio programmer. This is me.

I find myself at the intersection of the Arts and Technology. I love both! Evolving alongside the tech world while honing in on my music - a concept as old as humanity - has me adapting ideas that utilize both. Telling a narrative through an auditory medium is one of my guilty pleasures...there's something satisfying about matching the "right" sound to the visuals given. From building my own ham radios to creating particle physics audio simulators in VR, I've enjoyed my entire journey of audio development so far. What's not to love? 

I'm currently pursuing a dual degree at Harvard and Berklee, studying Computer Science and Electronic Production & Design. Under the direction of Dr. Van Troyer, my undergrad thesis is the creation of an AI synthesizer that uses magenta tensorflow models to mimic a player's likeness! It's on my Github so feel free to check it out and tinker with it.
In another life, I'd love to travel around the world to find inspiration at the convergence of traditional art, new media, and emerging technologies.
