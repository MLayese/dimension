Hi hi hi! I'm Myron if we haven't already been introduced. I find myself at the intersection of the Arts and Technology. I love both! From building my own ham radios to creating particle physics audio simulators in VR, I've enjoyed my entire journey of audio development so far. What's not to love? 

I'm currently pursuing a dual degree at Harvard and Berklee, studying Computer Science and Electronic Production & Design. Under the direction of Dr. Van Troyer, my undergrad thesis is the creation of an AI synthesizer that uses magenta tensorflow models to mimic a player's likeness! It's on my Github so feel free to check it out and tinker with it. Besides that, I'm currently involved in two projects with MIT and Ozy Media, assisting in the research of AI voice mimicry and VR therapy for performance anxiety! 
 
By the way, check out my <a href="#Portfolio">work</a> and see my <a href="#Reel"> reel</a>!
 
Ciao
