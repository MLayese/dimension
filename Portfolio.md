	<h4><a href="#stagefright">StageFright</a></h4>
	<blockquote>VR application I built to combat performance anxiety. Measures people's biometrics and adjusts the game in response - whether that be decreasing the amount of people in the crowd or just giving you positive affrimations that you're doing lovely. This project also has funding from OZY media and AT&T so hopefully it goes summer in the future! NOTE: Also still a work in progress and I'm currently using it for research at the MIT Immersion Lab! Really neat stuff that I'll continue to update.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Wwise Implementation for the Unity 3D Game Kit. Made intermittent emmiters for a lot of the ambiance, designed the sounds for the monsters, main character, weapons, and music! This demo video only covers Level 1 of the game but more will be released soon. Click on the title for more info.

	<h4>Project: Overdrive</h4>					
	<blockquote>Linear Sound Redesign for the League of Legends Trailer PROJECT: OVERDRIVE. This was the first project we had to in school for sound designs and I thought it was really cool! I chose this scene particularly because during that "glitch" sequence i thought to myself "Huh, there can be a lot of cool sounds for this." I hope I delievered! Recorded all of the SFX ('cept the the gun and shuriken sounds) on a Zoom microphone!</blockquote>

	<h4>Sound Synth Island</h4>
	<blockquote>A day project my friends and I made at MIT using Unity and Wwise. We just had to make a project that could play sounds on collision but we thought it'd be fun to have everything float and be differentiating objects from one another. Created in VR using the XRTK assets for VR integration. The sounds and sound implementation were created by me using a KORG monologue synthesizer.</blockquote>

	<h4>BreakOut</h4>
	<blockquote>Made a simple Breakout Game in Wwise and Unity to study game development and audio implementation. Objects are "tagged" and whenever the ball is hits a tagged object a random container associated with the tag will play a sound. Also the music is assigned to Pitch float value that decreases everytime you lose a life.</blockquote>
