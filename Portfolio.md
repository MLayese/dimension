	<h4>Project: Overdrive</h4>
	<blockquote>Linear Sound Redesign for the League of Legends Trailer PROJECT: OVERDRIVE. This was the first project we had to in school for sound designs and I thought it was really cool! I chose this scene particularly because during that "glitch" sequence i thought to myself "Huh, there can be a lot of cool sounds for this." I hope I delievered! Recorded all of the SFX ('cept the the gun and shuriken sounds) on a Zoom microphone!</blockquote>

	<h4>3D Game Kit</h4>
	<blockquote>Wwise Implementation for the Unity 3D Game Kit. Made intermittent emmiters for a lot of the ambiance, designed the sounds for the monsters, main character, weapons, and music! This demo video only cpvers Level 1 of the game but more will be released soon. If anyone is interested I also have a README.md file that goes into more detail of all the sounds and scripts I wrote. </blockquote>

	<h4>AI Synth</h4>
	<blockquote>Undergrad Thesis Project that uses Machine Learning Models from Magenta to create music in response to what you do. I used the Helm Plugin by Matt Tytel and created presets for the synthesizers. It functions like a normal synth and can record-enable, so if you're not iinterested in the ML stuff and just want to make tunes go ahead! This is a WIP so I will continually update this. It's also on Github if you ever want to check out the build and tinker with it yourself. Just fork the repository.</blockquote>

	<h4>Phylo</h4>
	<blockquote>Audio reactive code that responds in accordance to music. Everything made by me.</blockquote>

	<h4>Sound Synth Island</h4>
	<blockquote>A day project my friends and I made at MIT using Unity and Wwise. We just had to make a project that could play sounds on collision but we thought it'd be fun to have everything float and be differentiating objects from one another. Created in VR using the XRTK assets for VR integration. The sounds and sound implementation were created by me using a KORG monologue synthesizer.</blockquote>

	<h4>StageFright</h4>
	<blockquote>VR application I built to combat performance anxiety. Measures people's biometrics and adjusts the game in response - whether that be decreasing the amount of people in the crowd or just giving you positive affrimations that you're doing lovely. This project also has funding from OZY media and AT&T so hopefully it goes summer in the future! NOTE: Also still a work in progress and I'm currently using it for research at the MIT Immersion Lab! Really neat stuff that I'll continue to update.</blockquote>

	<h4>BreakOut</h4>
	<blockquote>Made a simple Breakout Game in Wwise and Unity to study game development and audio implementation. Objects are "tagged" and whenever the ball is hits a tagged object a random container associated with the tag will play a sound. Also the music is assigned to Pitch float value that decreases everytime you lose a life.</blockquote>

	<h4>VRDrumKit</h4>
	<blockquote>Drum models made in Blender and all the sounds recorded in the Berklee Studios! Scene was loaded in Unity and uses the OVR Oculus Integration kit for VR capabilities. If it wasn't clear, I made everything myself.</blockquote>
