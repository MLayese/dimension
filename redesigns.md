	<h4>Project: Overdrive</h4>
	<blockquote>Linear Sound Redesign for the League of Legends Trailer PROJECT: OVERDRIVE. This was the first project we had to in school for sound designs and I thought it was really cool! I chose this scene particularly because during that "glitch" sequence i thought to myself "Huh, there can be a lot of cool sounds for this." I hope I delievered! Recorded all of the SFX ('cept the the gun and shuriken sounds) on a Zoom microphone!</blockquote>

	<h4>3D Game Kit</h4>
	<blockquote>Wwise Implementation for the Unity 3D Game Kit. Made intermittent emmiters for a lot of the ambiance, designed the sounds for the monsters, main character, weapons, and music! This demo video only cpvers Level 1 of the game but more will be released soon. If anyone is interested I also have a <a href="https://github.com/MLayese/MTEC-421">README.md</a> file that goes into more detail of all the sounds and scripts I wrote. </blockquote>
