<h4 class="major">About</h4>
  
StageFright is an immersive VR experience that aims to combat Music Performance Anxiety (MPA) by simulating a music performance, measuring users' biofeedback, and teaching them how to apply Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques to redefine their emotional response to MPA.

To evaluate our method, we will perform an hour-long User Study that will test teaching benefits by assessing whether the anxiety of the user decreases after using StageFright. 10 participants, all 18+, will be divided into 2 conditions and will be asked to fill out a self-assessment form at the start and end of the study. Participants in Condition 1 will use StageFright with automatic cues that aim to help them respond better to increased levels of stress, and participants in Condition 2 will use a version of the experience without cues. After another form, both Conditions will use the unassisted version of the experience to assess the teaching benefits of StageFright.

We will capture biometric data in a non-invasive way by using a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor that straps around the userâ€™s fingers, and a wrist heart rate sensor.

We believe that this study falls into Category 3 (Benign Behavioral Intervention) of the COUHES Exemption guidelines.
